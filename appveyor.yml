  # If you don't need to build C extensions on 64-bit Python 3.3 or 3.4,
  # you can remove "build.cmd" from the front of the command, as it's
  # only needed to support those cases.

  # the interpreter you're using - Appveyor does not do anything special
  # to put the Python evrsion you want to use on PATH.
